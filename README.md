This is a mini project on Sorting Algorithm Visualiser, which uses Tkinter module for providing user interface and the code of sorting algorithms is written using Python.

Features of the project:
1. Generates random numbers for sorting by taking minimum and maximum values and size as an input from the user.
2. It also has a speed button, which allows users to specify the desired speed of visualisation.
3. It has 8 Sorting algorithms for visualisation.

List of Sorting Algorithms:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Merge Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Insertion Sort
6. Bogo Sort
7. Heap Sort
8. Counting Sort
